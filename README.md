## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project was built for the purpose of enhancing Buildium's (https://www.buildium.com/) social media presence on their web application.  


# My Awesome Project
Showcasing the Light/Dark mode toggle, social media trends, and a dashboard type design, this project establishes a clear prioritization of Buildium's consumer analytics to improve core aspects, continuing Buildium's forward trajectory.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, SCSS, GULP, JavaScript, 

Framing the HTML with best practices, writing SCSS with variables to keep consistency, while compiling with GULP and writing clean javascript to ensure functionality. UI/UX is an art these days, and I wanted to use a really cool design to highlight Buildium's social expansion. 

## Optimizations

Moving from CSS to SCSS allowed for a more uniformed design with scalability in mind. Thinking about automating the data from realtime statistics, the dashboard was created to inspire both the consumer towards security in your company and the company towards constant improvement.

## Lessons Learned:

Even when building a user friendly dashboard, thinking about the end goal will always improve early stage refactoring and thus increase the accessibility of the system design. 

## Examples:
